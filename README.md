# Headphone-Audio-Quality-Checker (WIP)

- Designed and implemented a web application to create a new metric that can be used to compare the audio quality of headphones.
- Developed a web service using **REST API in Node.js** to register a device with the environment (normal, noisy, or windy).
- Incorporated **Twilio APIs** to send the registration confirmation SMS along with the recording session information.
- The web service will record the voice of the user and will evaluate the quality and it will give the analysis result.
